# AKV: Online Product Exchange Platform

## Abstract

The project aims to develop an Online Product Exchange Platform. It focuses on enabling users to list products for sale and purchase items within a 50km radius, ensuring convenience for local transactions. **The existing online marketplace platforms** offer vast listings without focusing on locality or distance-based search filtering leading to inefficiencies for users seeking to buy or sell items within their local area. **The proposed AKV solution introduces a location-based filtering mechanism** that allows users to see products currently available within a 50km radius. This solution aims to enhance user experience by prioritizing local deals, reducing shipping costs and times and fostering community interactions.

The tech stack which will be used is: React.js for the frontend and UI of the product, Node.js with Express.js will be essential for handling server-side requests. Database like MySQL will be used for flexible data storage and retrieval, allowing for efficient handling of structured and unstructured data. Keywords: **Online Marketplace, Local Transactions, Geolocation filtering, React.js, Node.js, MySQL**

The scope of this project is to streamline the process of local buying and selling, making it more efficient and convenient for users.**

## Architecture Diagram

This architecture diagram serves as a high-level overview of the user's interaction with the platform, outlining the key processes involved in the online buying and selling experience.

It's important for visualizing and planning the development of such a platform, ensuring both user roles have a seamless and intuitive workflow.

The diagram is organized with clear directional flow, indicating the steps a user would take when interacting with the system either as a buyer or a seller.

The seller's journey is about product listing, while the buyer's journey is about navigating the marketplace, making a purchase, and receiving the product.
